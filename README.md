# RamanSeg

This is my fork of this-does-not-look-like-that, a paper and repo that investigated the original ProtoPNet paper.

My fork heavily modifies it, to support segmentation training, inspired by ProtoSeg.

- Requirements in `requirements.txt`
- Main training code in `train.py`
- New model arch in `src/models/seg_model.py`
- Misc notebooks to generate graphs, e.g. `model_result.ipynb` for the results.
